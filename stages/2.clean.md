# Data Wrangling
This section outlines all the data transformation processes done to dataset.

## Pre-Modification Measures
Before any data transformation, measures were taken to ensure data integrity.

**Creation of Backup Sheet**<br>
A backup of the original dataset was created.
The backup sheet was protected to prevent modifications and hidden from the working environment to avoid accidental changes.

**Data Integrity Checks**<br>
Prior to any modification, thorough checks were conducted to ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset.

## Cleaning Steps Applied

**Convert Data to Table**<br>
The data was converted into a table format to enhance data handling and analysis capabilities.

**Duplicate Record Removal**<br>
Identified and removed 13 duplicate records based on multiple criteria: property_id, latitude, longitude, address, type, and price. Remain 230 unique records.

**Removal of Irrelevant & Duplicated Columns**<br>
Removed repeated and irrelevant columns (e.g., address, images, status, and added) to streamline the dataset.

**Handling Zeros and Null Values**<br>
Applied conditional formatting to highlight records with values below zero, such as distance_to_uol, time_by_walk, and price, as well as to identify empty records. 6 records were removed and remain 224.

**Concatenation of Column Values**<br>
Concatenated the fname and sname columns using the CONCAT and TRIM functions to create a full_name column for the agent.

**Text to Column**<br>
Split the address field, which contained both the address line and the area within Leicester, into two separate columns using a comma delimiter.

**Standardisation of Similar Addresses**<br>
Standardised minor inconsistencies where the same address appeared differently after splitting the column.

**Data Formatting**<br>
Formatted the data appropriately for currency, distance, and time to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting and analysis.

**Renaming Column Names**<br>
Renamed several columns to more appropriate titles (e.g., member, trade, property, type) for clarity.
